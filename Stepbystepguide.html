<h3>Step-by-Step Guide</h3>
<p>From this point on, you are in charge of your design. You have the ownership to make your design as small or big as you wish. The most important thing to remember is to have fun and keep practising.</p>
<div class="guide">
<h5>Step 1</h5>
<div class="imgwithtxt">
<img src="Images/Guide/1.jpg" width="200" height="200">
<p> The simplest way to start off is with a flower. Yes, it's that easy!</br/> Once you've completed this, you could add different shapes to continue the design as shown in step 2.</p>  
</div>
<h5>Step 2</h5>
<div class="imgwithtxt">
<img src="Images/Guide/2.jpg" width="200" height="200">
<p> So you can continue with a swirl or the other shape on the right which is also referred to as the "Mango Shape".</p>  
</div>
<h5>Step 3</h5>
<div class="imgwithtxt">
<img src="Images/Guide/3.jpg" width="200" height="200">
<p>Time to add some lines to support your shapes.</p>  
</div>
<h5>Step 4</h5>
<div class="imgwithtxt">
<img src="Images/Guide/4.jpg" width="200" height="200">
<p> Now that you have added your lines, you have come to a meeting point to make a v shape. This is where your lines meet. </p>  
</div>
<h5>Step 5</h5>
<div class="imgwithtxt">
<img src="Images/Guide/5.jpg" width="200" height="200">
<p> And this is a perfect opportunity to make another flower.</p>  
</div>
<h5>Step 6</h5>
<div class="imgwithtxt">
<img src="Images/Guide/6.jpg" width="200" height="200">
<p> Now you've come to a tricky situation. There is no v sections, but there is a flower! On this flower you have so many options to continue with. You could use another swirl or a mango shape. The choice is yours!</p>  
</div>
<h5>Step 7</h5>
<div class="imgwithtxt">
<img src="Images/Guide/7.jpg" width="200" height="200">
<p> Support your shape with some lines.</p>  
</div>
<h5>Step 8</h5>
<div class="imgwithtxt">
<img src="Images/Guide/8.jpg" width="200" height="200">
<p>Essentially, you continue your design with this trick... Watch out for the V shapes! Its the perfect opportunity to make a flower and make your design flowery.</p>
