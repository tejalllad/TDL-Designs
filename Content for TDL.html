<h3>About</h3>

<p>Hello and welcome TDL-Designs! On this page you will learn a bit more about me and my services.<br/><br/>I am a self-taught henna artist and I am here today to give to you an online step-by-step guide on how to start henna designing. There are different types of patterns you can combine together to make your own design and with this online guide, you will be able to see how simple and easy it is to do.</p>

<h4>What initiated the idea of creating an online step-by-step guide?</h4>
<p>Well, during my time at university, a lot of my friends were insprired by my work and wanted to start henna designing too but they didn't know how to start! I have always been a creative individual and recently asked myself why keep it to myself? Why not try bring out the creativity in everyone? These questions inspired me to create this website and to bring out the best in people. </p>

<h4>What if I do not have enough time to learn or do not want to learn and just want a henna tattoo?</h4>
<p>I have also added my contact details and price range on this website so if you simply only want a henna tattoo or would like to hire me for my services at one of your events/parties, you can contact me and I will be happy to be in your service.</p>
